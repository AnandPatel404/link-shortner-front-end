							You don’t need an Account to create Bitly Links, and you can use many of the features of the Services without registering,
							thereby limiting the type of information that is collected about you individually. If you have a Bitly Account, you may
							access, correct, or request deletion of your personal information by logging into your Account. Once logged in to your
							account, you will be able to view a history of the URLs you have shortened and the metrics pages for those URLs. You can
							request a complete copy of the personal information we store about your account by clicking the button to request a report
							in your Account Settings. For more information on how to request access to your information, please see our help article.
						</p>
						<p>
							You can delete your Account at any time through your Account settings page. If you delete your Account, you will no longer
							be able to access or use the Services. If you have an Account but are unable to access it, you can contact us at
							privacy@bitly.com. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe. If you are a resident of the EEA or
							Switzerland, you have the right to ask that your personal data be corrected, updated, or erased. Additionally, you may
							have the right to access your personal data and receive a copy of your personal data undergoing processing. You may also
							have the right to object to, or request that we restrict, certain processing.
						</p>
						<p>
							For all other requests to exercise any of your rights, you may contact us as indicated in the “Questions” section below.
							Once we receive your request, we will ask that you verify your identity such as by authenticating through your account. If
							you do not have a Bitly account, Bitly has no way of identifying you or verifying that you created or clicked on a Bitly
							link.
						</p>
						<p>
							You may be entitled, in accordance with applicable law, to submit a request through an authorized agent. To designate an
							authorized agent to exercise your rights and choices on your behalf, please provide a written attestation, declaration, or
							permission that has either been physically signed or provided electronically per applicable law. In certain circumstances,
							we may be required by law to retain your personal information.
						</p>
						<p>
							Please note that in the interest of ensuring that existing Bitly Links continue to function for all of our users, the
							Bitly Links that you have created and shared cannot be deleted or disabled (even if your Account is deleted), and any
							shortening and sharing activity that has already occurred on your Account also cannot be deleted. If you have concerns
							about any unauthorized use of your Account, you can delete your account within your Account settings.
